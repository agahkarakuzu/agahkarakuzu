I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at NeuroPoly Lab, and a Junior Fellow of the International Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (https://ismrm.org). My current research focuses on developing end-to-end reproducible measurement workflows for advanced quantitative MRI applications in neuroimaging. This novel approach necessitates addressing the issue of reproducibility on multiple fronts: 

1. **Standardized MRI acqusitions (Hardware integration)**
   
`MRI Physics` `Medical Imaging` `Open-source Software`

_Clinical MRI scanners commonly used in research are not designed as precise measurement devices. Achieving accurate and repeatable measurements requires more than relying on the vendor-provided acquisition software (i.e., pulse sequences) supplied by manufacturers._




3. 

[quantitative MRI (qMRI) applications under one umbrella](https://qmrlab.org) through [data standardization](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/), [vendor-neutral acquisitions](https://github.com/qmrlab/pulse_sequences), [fully transparent & reproducible workflows](https://github.com/qmrlab/qmrflow) and community building. To achieve this, I gained experience in: 

* Vendor-neutral pulse sequence development in RTHawk (by Vista AI) and Pulseq
* Container-mediated and data driven Nextflow pipelines
* Open-source image reconstruction
* Python/MATLAB/C++
  
I am the lead developer of https://neurolibre.org, an open-source platform for publishing reproducible preprints written in [MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org/) and [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html). It is quite an involved project which helped me gain development experience with the following tools: 
* Kubernetes on baremetal (to host BinderHub)
* Ruby on Rails (OpenJournals editorial manager) 
* OpenStack & OpenNebula
* Terraform
* Flask/Celery/NGINX based full-stack server
* GitHub actions development
* Academic publishing workflows

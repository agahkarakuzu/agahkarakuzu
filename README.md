I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at [NeuroPoly Lab](https://neuro.polymtl.ca) at [Polytechnique Montreal](https://www.polymtl.ca/) and a Junior Fellow of the [ISMRM](https://ismrm.org). I have a background in MRI physics, software development, biomedical applications of signal theory, and musculoskeletal biomechanics. 

My current research focuses on developing end-to-end measurement workflows for advanced quantitative MRI (qMRI) applications in neuroimaging, including multiparametric mapping and biophysics-driven microstructural imaging. My primary motivation is to elevate qMRI to a metrological standard, enabling the quantification of measurement uncertainty within a reproducible multi-vendor framework. This rigorous approach necessitates addressing the issue of reproducibility through a multistep process, with each following research objective contributing to a comprehensive solution:

1. **Standardized MRI acqusitions (Hardware Integration)**

  <summary>Context</summary>
  <i>Clinical MRI scanners commonly used in research are not designed as precise measurement devices. However, it is possible to relate raw MRI signals to specific physical properties by estimating numerical parameters from a set of MR images. Since this "quantitative" approach is not the intended use of commercially available scanners, relying on vendor-provided acquisition software (i.e., pulse sequences) can significantly compromise the reliability of these measurements.</i>

Vendor-neutral pulse sequence development is an emerging approach that provides an alternative to relying on vendor-specific software and acquisition control. I am interested in applying this approach to standardize MRI signal encoding for quantitative MRI (qMRI) measurements, ensuring reliability across scanners from different vendors (e.g., Siemens, GE, Philips, and Canon).

I have experience developing vendor-neutral sequences using both [RTHawk](https://vista.ai/products/research-rthawk/) (JavaScript) and [Pulseq](https://pulseq.github.io) (MATLAB, Python) platforms.

3. 

[quantitative MRI (qMRI) applications under one umbrella](https://qmrlab.org) through [data standardization](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/), [vendor-neutral acquisitions](https://github.com/qmrlab/pulse_sequences), [fully transparent & reproducible workflows](https://github.com/qmrlab/qmrflow) and community building. To achieve this, I gained experience in: 

* Container-mediated and data driven Nextflow pipelines
* Open-source image reconstruction
* Python/MATLAB/C++
  
I am the lead developer of https://neurolibre.org, an open-source platform for publishing reproducible preprints written in [MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org/) and [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html). It is quite an involved project which helped me gain development experience with the following tools: 
* Kubernetes on baremetal (to host BinderHub)
* Ruby on Rails (OpenJournals editorial manager) 
* OpenStack & OpenNebula
* Terraform
* Flask/Celery/NGINX based full-stack server
* GitHub actions development
* Academic publishing workflows

### Hi there 👋

I am a PhD candidate at NeuroPoly Lab under the supervision of Dr. Nikola Stikov.

My current research focuses on bringing [quantitative MRI (qMRI) applications under one umbrella](https://qmrlab.org) through [data standardization](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/), [vendor-neutral acquisitions](https://github.com/qmrlab/pulse_sequences), [fully transparent & reproducible workflows](https://github.com/qmrlab/qmrflow) and community building.

My motivation for open science is born from a combination of open-source development (BrainHack, MRathon, OpenMR) and science communication (MRM Highlights, OHBM Blog, ISMRM’s MRPulse).

⛷☕️🎸🎨😸📚🎙➕👨‍💻🧲🧠
